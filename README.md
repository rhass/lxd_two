# lxd_two

This is a fairly bare-bones cookbook designed to install LXD and nothing more.
Configuration and management of LXD resources is best driven via Terraform
using https://github.com/sl1pm4t/terraform-provider-lxd


## Usage

To use this cookbook, simply add the `lxd_two::default` to your recipe or run list.
